# Gender-ID-using-voice-analysis
The whole idea of the project and the code is to identify and differentiate between Male and Female voices. There are a lot of biological differences between Male and Female voices, hence Gender Identification using Speech analysis can be done in several ways. In this project I have used one of the basic principles of Signal Analysis, CORRELATION.
